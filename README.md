# Contribot

## Getting Started

[Register an application on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
For development, you can set both the URL and callback URL to (e.g.) `http://localhost:3001`.

After registering your application, GitHub will supply you with a client ID and a client secret.
Set those to the respective environment variables `CONTRIBOT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `CONTRIBOT_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
